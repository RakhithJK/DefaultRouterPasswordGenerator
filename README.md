# DefaultRouterPasswordGenerator
Based on the algorithm published by GNU Citizen and on the work of Kevin Devine &lt;wyse101[at]gmail[dot]com>, this Java command-line tool calculates the default password for a given SSID. All the code is documented and Javadoc is present.  

Note that this programâ€™s only intended purpose is educational usage. Needless to state: illegal use is forbidden and condemned.

# Usage
Vulnerable SSIDs have the following format
NAME-ENDING

An example of this is "SpeedTouch-43D1LJ"*. Only enter the ENDING, which is 43D1LJ on the commandline.
